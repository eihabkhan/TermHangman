# A simple hangman game that you can play in the terminal.
I built this game from [Paul Hudson](https://www.hackingwithswift.com)'s awesome [Pro Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/store/pro-swift) book

## How To Play:
1. Clone Repo
2. Navigate to downloaded repo and extract compressed folder
3. Open a terminal window and change directory to the extracted folder (i.e `cd Downloads/TermHangman-master`)
4. Run the command `Swift hangman.swift`
5. Enjoy :)
